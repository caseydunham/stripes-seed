# Stripes Seed Project

## Introduction

A skeleton seed project to create Stripes web applications.

A few things to highlight:

* [Stripes](http://stripesframework.org) uses Java Server Pages so this will fit within any course using the [Java EE Tutorial](http://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/)
* Dependency injection is achieved through using [Google Guice](https://code.google.com/p/google-guice/)
* Database access is done using [Hibernate](http://www.hibernate.org/)
* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) is used for the build system

## Quick Start

Stripes Seed uses Maven, so starting it up locally is as easy as opening up a shell in the root of the application and typing

    $ mvn jetty:run

Open up a browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to get started.

To start working with the code in an IDE like Eclipse, check out the [m2eclipse](http://www.sonatype.org/m2eclipse/) plugin.
If using [IntelliJ](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/), you can import the project directly from the Start new project wizard.
